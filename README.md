Website link: [Emotional Feedback Channel](http://emo.uninoteshare.com:3000)

## Introduction

The Quick-Emotion Backchannel for Remote Lectures project aims to develop a fast and efficient emotion backchannel for remote lectures using an online chatroom platform. The project is built on **WebSocket**, a popular technology used in chat applications, and **ChartJS** for easy visualization of statistics. The objectives of the project include real-time statistics of each type of emotion feedback, visualization of the results, notices of results in each voting round, classroom image and message sharing, avatar and username customization, and storage of users' message history. This project aims to replace direct observation of students' faces in on-site lectures with a quick-emotion backchannel to provide valuable insights into student engagement and emotions during remote lectures.

## Tech Stacks

This project was built using a variety of technologies to achieve its goals. For real-time communication between clients and servers, **WebSocket** was utilized. **ChartJS** was used as a JavaScript library for data visualization. An auto-compression package was also used for sending images that exceeded 500MB. To create responsive and mobile-first web pages, **Bootstrap** was used as the front-end framework. Finally, the back-end of the project was built using **Node.js** and **Express.js**, which are popular technologies for building scalable web applications.
